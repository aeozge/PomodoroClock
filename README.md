Pomodoro Clock Project!

Free Code Camp-Front End Project. 

I created this project by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript on Sublime Text. 


In this project, I can customize the length of Break and Session(minute). Then, I can start by clicking on Session Clock. 
The session will continue to fill up to the length of the minute I set and the alarm will sound after it has been filled. This will be repeated as long as I set the break length. If I want to change the length of Break or Session,I can press Reset button.
